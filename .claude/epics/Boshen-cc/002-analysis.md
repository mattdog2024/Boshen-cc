# Issue #3 Analysis: K线识别算法核心开发

## Work Stream Analysis

This task involves complex computer vision algorithms and can be broken down into sequential work streams:

### Stream A: Screenshot and Image Capture
**Files**: `BoshenCC.Services/Implementations/ScreenshotService.cs`, `BoshenCC.Core/Core/ImageProcessor.cs`
**Description**: Implement screen capture functionality for specific windows and regions
**Dependencies**: Issue #2 (基础架构) must be completed
**Agent Type**: general-purpose

### Stream B: Image Preprocessing and Enhancement
**Files**: `BoshenCC.Core/Core/ImageProcessor.cs` (enhance), `BoshenCC.Core/Utils/ImageFilters.cs`
**Description**: Implement image preprocessing algorithms (grayscale, filtering, noise reduction)
**Dependencies**: Stream A (must have image capture first)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose

### Stream C: K-line Detection and Recognition
**Files**: `BoshenCC.Core/Services/KLineRecognitionService.cs`, `BoshenCC.Core/Utils/BoundaryDetector.cs`
**Description**: Implement core K-line detection using OpenCV algorithms
**Dependencies**: Stream B (preprocessed images needed)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose

### Stream D: Color Analysis and Classification
**Files**: `BoshenCC.Core/Utils/ColorDetector.cs`, `BoshenCC.Models/KLineInfo.cs`
**Description**: Implement K-line color detection and classification (red/green)
**Dependencies**: Stream C (detected K-line regions needed)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose

### Stream E: Structure Analysis and Data Models
**Files**: `BoshenCC.Core/Utils/KLineAnalyzer.cs`, `BoshenCC.Models/KLineStructure.cs`
**Description**: Implement K-line structure analysis (body, upper shadow, lower shadow)
**Dependencies**: Stream C and D (detection and color analysis needed)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose

## Parallel Execution Plan

Since this is an algorithm-heavy task with strong dependencies:
1. **Stream A** → **Stream B** → **Stream C** → (**Stream D** + **Stream E** in parallel)

## Implementation Notes

- Target 95%+ recognition accuracy
- Response time < 500ms per K-line
- Use EmguCV 3.4.3 for image processing
- Implement robust error handling for edge cases
- Create comprehensive test data set

## Risk Factors

- Image quality variations affecting recognition accuracy
- Different chart software color schemes
- Performance optimization for real-time processing
- Complex K-line patterns (doji, hammer, etc.)

## Success Metrics

- Recognition accuracy: ≥95%
- Processing time: <500ms per K-line
- Memory usage: <50MB during processing
- Support for various chart resolutions and scales
